# URKEL: Did I Do That?

**This project uses the following npm packages:**
+ [Express-Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars)
+ [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
+ [Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
+ [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) 
+ and [Body-Parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser)

It's a basic application with a limited front-end that simply allows users to add to-do items and complete items on the to-do list.   

The back-end is where the majority of the focus is, with files separated and connected following MVC architectural pattern concepts.
